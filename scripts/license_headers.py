"""Stamp every file WE wrote with the Apache-2.0 notice -- and nothing else.

Borrowed from citra-decision-system, which uses the same licence and the same
exclusion lists below are this repository's own.

The tool this replaces walked the filesystem with `find`. Run in the tree it
was written for it reported 6,079 files missing headers when only 979 were
tracked by git: the rest were `.venv-seed/Lib/site-packages`, and it would have
written
"Copyright (c) Trustedwear Tech Private Limited. PROPRIETARY - all rights
reserved" into certifi, boto3, pydantic and every other dependency. Claiming
ownership of other people's Apache and MIT code is the most damaging thing a
licence-enforcement effort can do, because it is the first thing the other side
will point at.

So the file list comes from `git ls-files`. If it is not tracked, it is not
ours, and we do not touch it. That single decision is the point of this script.

The old header was also wrong on its face: it said PROPRIETARY / all rights
reserved / NOT an open-source grant, in a repository licensed Apache-2.0 with an
explicit grant. Two contradictory statements of terms invite an
ambiguity argument, and ambiguity is construed against its author. The header
below states the actual licence, with the registered SPDX id that scanners
recognise.
