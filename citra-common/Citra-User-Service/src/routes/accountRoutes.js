// These handlers live in google-auth.js / delete-account.js for historical
// reasons (that's where Google auth was first built), but none of them are
// Google-specific -- they read the JWT and look up the user document, same
// as a local- or OIDC-authenticated session would. Mounting them here,
// unconditionally, fixes a real bug: they used to be reachable only when
// AUTH_PROVIDERS included 'google' (see googleAuthRoutes.js), so a
// local-only deployment (AUTH_PROVIDERS=local) had no working /me or
// /logout -- every session check 404'd. See ARCHITECTURE.md / the
// 2026-08-09 auth-strip note.
