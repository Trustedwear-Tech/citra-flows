/**
 * Org — top-level tenant container.
 *
 * Each row is an organization that owns users, depts, and resources.
 * Seeded from `config/orgs.seed.json` on service startup (idempotent upsert).
 *
 * Org is the parent container for Dept (depts.org_id → orgs.id) and for
 * every user/resource carrying an `org_id`. Unlike Dept, the seed is NOT
 * single-tenant scoped — orgs ARE the tenants.
 *
 * Deletion of an Org row is refused via the admin API when any user still
 * references it; the seed never prunes orgs (orgs may be created via the
 * admin API and intentionally not present in the seed file).
