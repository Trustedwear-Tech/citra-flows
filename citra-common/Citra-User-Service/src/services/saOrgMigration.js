/**
 * Cross-collection rewrite when a user's Personal/Work SA changes id
 * (org-move case). Without this, every resource on the OLD SA becomes
 * orphaned — invisible to the user in Mine/Shared/Admin tabs.
 *
 * Trigger: `mirrorOrgChange` / `mirrorWorkSAOrgChange` after they mint
 * the new SA id. The OLD SA doc is left in place by design (historical
 * audit), but all live resources move to the new SA so the user keeps
 * seeing their work.
 *
 * Single-tenant + pre-prod: we use Mongo `update_many` per collection,
 * not a background job. The PATCH that triggered this is already
 * happening server-side; users moving across orgs is rare enough that
 * inline rewrites are acceptable. Per-collection failures are logged
 * and skipped — the user-doc update has already succeeded and the
 * remaining collections can be retried by an admin via the same PATCH.
 *
 * NOTE: We do NOT rewrite the SA's own document. The OLD SA stays; the
 * NEW SA is freshly minted by the caller. Only resource docs that
 * reference the SA's id in their `owner_id` get updated.
