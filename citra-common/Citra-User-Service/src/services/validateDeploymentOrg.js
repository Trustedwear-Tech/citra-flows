/**
 * validateDeploymentOrg — fail-loud boot guard for the deployment's ORG_ID.
 *
 * Single-customer posture: every deployment is pinned to exactly one org via
 * the ORG_ID env. That value is the source of truth that UI-login users are
 * stamped with (deploymentDefaults.js), that depts are seeded under, and that
 * downstream services (data-discovery crawler, dept-MCPs) must agree on. A
 * typo'd or missing ORG_ID silently creates a phantom org — users land in an
 * org with no depts/sources and nothing errors. This guard turns that silent
 * misconfig into a hard boot failure.
 *
 * Runs AFTER orgSeed so a seed-created org counts. If ORG_ID is set but no
 * matching `orgs` row exists we throw, and the caller aborts startup (RULE:
 * fail loud, fail early). If ORG_ID is unset we warn — leaving it empty is a
 * deliberate multi-tenant/dev choice (deploymentDefaults no-ops), not a
 * failure, so we don't block boot on it.
