/**
 * Resource taxonomy — single source of truth across the platform.
 *
 * MANAGED resources are admin-visible: dept_admin / org_admin can list,
 * transfer, and delete them. On user deletion the admin chooses keep /
 * transfer-to-SA / transfer-to-dept / delete via the per-resource picker.
 *
 * PERSONAL resources are admin-invisible. On user deletion they are
 * hard-cascade-deleted (no picker, just a count + confirmation). Sharing
 * is per-resource (team_share + public_share) via the centralised
 * authorization_service.
 *
 * KEEP THESE THREE LISTS IN LOCKSTEP:
 *   - Citra-User-Service/src/config/resourceTaxonomy.js  (this file, JS)
 *   - Citra-Service/config/resource_taxonomy.py          (Python)
 *   - Citra-UI/services/resourceTaxonomy.js              (frontend mirror)
