"""Real-Redis CONTRACT test for citra_queue — the end-to-end behaviour every
consumer (smart-app triggers, workflow worker) depends on:

  round-trip + ack → retry parks with backoff (off the stream) → not delivered
  before due → promote-when-due redelivers (bumped retries) → exhaust → DLQ →
  permanent failure → DLQ.

This is the guard against a change to citra_queue silently breaking a consumer:
smart-app's own tests MOCK the queue, so only a real-Redis exercise of the public
API catches a contract/mechanics break. Skipped automatically when no Redis is
reachable (local dev without Redis stays green); CI runs it against a redis
service. Uses a unique queue name per run + cleans up.
