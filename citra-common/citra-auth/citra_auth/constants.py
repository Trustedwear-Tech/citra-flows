"""
Shared identity vocabulary — the fixed string constants for the platform's
roles plus the small fixed token-sets (owner_type, entity_type).

Import these instead of hard-coding string literals (`"super_admin"`, …) so that:
  • a typo is an immediate AttributeError (`Roles.SUPERADMIN`), not a
    silently-wrong string that fails a check open or closed;
  • there is ONE authoritative list of valid role names per runtime;
  • adding a new role is a one-line change here, referenced everywhere.

This is ONLY the vocabulary (the names). Authorization LOGIC — which roles may
do what — stays inline in each service: a route composes its own set from these
constants, e.g. `{Roles.DEPT_ADMIN, Roles.ORG_ADMIN, Roles.SUPER_ADMIN}`. There
is deliberately NO central role→capability mapping here.

`Roles.ALL` mirrors the Citra-User-Service `CitraAIUser.roles` Mongoose enum
(the authoritative declaration). Keep the two aligned — `tests/test_constants.py`
pins this side; the Node side (`Citra-User-Service/src/constants/roles.js`) feeds
the model enum directly so it can't drift from Node code.
