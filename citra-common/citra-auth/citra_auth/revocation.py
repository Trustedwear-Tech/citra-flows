"""
Token revocation seam for the shared JWT middleware.

``JWTAuthMiddleware`` rejects any token whose ``jti`` is revoked. The actual
blocklist lives in the ``revoked_tokens`` Mongo collection (written by
Citra-User-Service on impersonation-revoke / demotion), but citra-auth is
deliberately dependency-light and does NOT own a Mongo client. So a consuming
service REGISTERS a checker at startup and the middleware calls it:

    from citra_auth import register_revocation_checker

    async def _is_revoked(jti: str) -> bool:
        return await db.revoked_tokens.find_one({"jti": jti}) is not None

    register_revocation_checker(_is_revoked)   # call once at app startup

The checker may be sync or async and should be cache-fronted by the service
(the middleware calls it on every authenticated request). If no checker is
registered, revocation is NOT enforced for that service — to avoid a SILENT
gap (RULE #1: fail loud), the middleware logs a one-time warning the first time
it sees a token carrying a ``jti`` with no checker wired.
